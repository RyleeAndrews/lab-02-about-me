    <h1>About Me Rylee Andrews</h1>
    <p>My name is Rylee Andrews and I am originally from Montana. Growing up my parents owned a t-shirt printing shop, so I developed a love for clothes. So my senior year I started my own clothing line and have been working on it since. Outside of working on my clothing I ski and snowboard and cliff jump during the summer. I'm a huge raver and you will most likely see me at every USC event. My favorite food is sushi and my favorite roll is the spider roll. I have been to Canada and the Bahamas and I dream of seeing Thailand.</p>
    <h2>How I Got Into Coding</h2>
    <p>I got into coding because my buddy Sam, who also attended code fellows, told me to look into getting into code fellows. So I started learning coding online with bucky. I knew I wanted to further pursue this right after I finished the first tutorial on html and css I absolutely loved it! My favorite language by far is javascript just becuase of the many possibilites it gives you.</p>
    <h2>Future goals</h2>
    <p>My future goals are to become a full stacked javascript developer and be able to completely design ecommerce sites for all my future business ventures. Like everyone's goal we all want to be rich but I actually work for it so a nice house on the ocean is in my future.</p>
