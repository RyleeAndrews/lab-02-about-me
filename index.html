    <h1>About Me Rylee Andrews</h1>
    <p>My name is Rylee Andrews and I am originally from Montana. Growing up my parents owned a t-shirt printing shop, so I developed a love of clothes. So my senior year I started my own clothing line and have been working on it since. Outside of working on my clothing I ski and snowboard and cliff jump during the summer. I also am a huge raver and most likely see me at every USC event.</p>
    <h2>Future goals</h2>

    <p>My future goals are to become a full stacked javascript developer and be able to completely design ecommerce sites for all my future business ventures. Like everyone's goal we all want to be rich but I actually work for it so a nice house on the ocean is in my future.</p>
